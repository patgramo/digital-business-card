            <p>I'm a front-end web developer with a strong background in teaching and learning.
            I was a 6th grade science teacher in NYC for 6 years. I enjoy learning and have built a thorough understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, React and WordPress. I'm always looking for new projects and clients to work with! </p>
